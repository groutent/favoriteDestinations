# favoriteDestinations

Created By Team JOT: Jonathan, Olga and Tristan

This app was created with the intent that it can provide users with a quick way to record locations you want to remember in the future. As such, it is crafted in a way that allows the user to scroll through the locations in a dynamic fashion. Furthermore, it also allows the user to find themselves on a map, search new locations and also play sounds to the slightly visually impaired when a new location is created and when one is deleted. Lastly, the API implemented offers an option for the user to generate a picture associated with the location that can help them better remember the destination.

Resources Used: Example Slides from Lecture, repurposed to satisfy needs and app functionality. 

No special instructions needed to run the app.
